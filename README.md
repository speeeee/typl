# What is typl?

typl is a strongly-typed language with a syntax that resembles LISP (though it is not necessarily a LISP dialect).  The language is based off of the use of predicates in the place of traditional type-checking.  More of it is explained in DOCS.md.

The language is written in Racket and compiles to C.
